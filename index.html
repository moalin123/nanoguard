<h2>What is NanoGuard?</h2>    
<p>NanoGuard is a smart, eco-friendly mask designed to protect you with advanced filters,
    health sensors, and self-cleaning technology - all at once
</p>
</section>


<section data-aos="fade-up" class="section">
    <h2>Core Features - How does it work?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nanoparticle Biosensors:</strong> Detect pathogens in the air at a microscopic level</li>
        <li><strong>Electrochemical Sensors:</strong> Measures air temperature, humidity and air pressure in real time - especially helpful for those with respiratory conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth Module:</strong> Sends health data securely to your device in real time.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphene or Copper-Infused Filter:</strong> Neutralises germs and improves air quality.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2> How is it powered?</h2>
    <p>Our proposal for future NanoGuard models: a mask that runs on clean, wearable energy - no bulky batteries</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Motion Power (Piezo/Triebo-electric):</strong> Converts breathing & face movement into energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Solar Strip:</strong> Thin-film solar cells recharge it in light.</li>
     <li><strong>Lithium Polymer Battery:</strong> To aid in case of increased demand/lack of movement</li>
    <li><strong>Energy Stored:</strong> In a micro-capacitor that powers the sensors + Bluetooth.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Cost & Accessibility:</h2>
    <p>For NanoGuard, not only do we value innovation and creativity, we also consider affordability - which is we are introducing two models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard Everday Use:</strong> Budget friendly with key protection feautures like copper-based antimicrobial properties for self cleaning.</li>
       <li><strong>Surgical Use:</strong> Full smart features, including graphene infused filters for enhanced durability and advanced sensors designed for the medical environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both models are lightweight, reusable and designed for your peace of mind</p>
</section>

<section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Why Choose NanoGuard?</h2>
    <p>
        NanoGuard stands out with its advanced properties and comfortable fit. We make sure that NanoGuard is durable, reliable, environmentally-friendly and perfect for a wide range of users.
